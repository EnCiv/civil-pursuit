This is just the beginning.\n\nThis is not a survey, this is a new kind of tool that is designed to help us discuss our ideas and productively converge on what unites us.\n\nAfter expressing your views, you will get to see others, and you will get to say why some are more or less important to discuss further. And you will get to see what others say as well. Then after each round we will invite you back to be part of the next one, considering the most unifying ideas from the previous round, until we converge on the conclusions that unite us.\n\nThis is a new tool, early in its development and we invite you to provide feedback along the way so we can keep making it better.",
