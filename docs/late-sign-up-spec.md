# Late Sign-Up Feature Specification

## Overview

This specification describes the "Late Sign-Up" feature that allows users to explore the deliberation experience before committing to sign up. Users can participate through Round 1 (round 0 in code) using the `useAuth` skip method to create a temporary account. All data is stored in localStorage throughout all rounds, then batch-upserted to the server at key checkpoints (after each round completion). Users are prompted to provide their email at the intermission after Round 1 to continue. This reduces the barrier to entry and allows users to build trust and interest before providing personal information.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**

- Users are immediately greeted with `app/components/sign-up.jsx` as the first step
- This creates a barrier to entry, preventing users from understanding what the deliberation is about
- Few users utilize the "Skip" feature which assigns a temporary userId
- Data is immediately upserted to the database via socket API calls, requiring a userId association from the start

**Issues:**

- High bounce rate at the sign-up page
- Users cannot evaluate the deliberation process before committing
- Trust and interest building happens after the commitment, not before

## Objectives

1. Remove sign-up friction by allowing users to skip registration through Round 1 (round 0 in code)
2. Use civil-client's `useAuth` skip method to create temporary user accounts
3. Store all user data in localStorage for all rounds (not just anonymous users)
4. Batch-upsert localStorage data to server after round completion and email submission
5. Request email at intermission after Round 1 to associate with the temporary account
6. Move demographic questions (jsform/moreDetails) to end of tournament steps, before intermission
7. Maintain backward compatibility with existing flows and tests

## Architecture & Data Flow

**Key Design Decision:** All rounds use localStorage as the primary data store on the client side. This provides a single, consistent code path and solves existing issues:

- Prevents loss of `groupIdsLists` on page refresh
- Prevents inconsistencies when users edit points that have already been shown to others
- Allows users to navigate forward/backward through steps until round completion
- Data is batch-upserted to server only at round completion or email submission

**useAuth Integration:** The anonymous user flow leverages `civil-client`'s `useAuth` hook (see `node_modules/civil-client/app/components/use-auth.js`):

- `methods.skip()` creates a temporary user account with a server-generated userId
- Skip triggers a page reload with a session cookie (has expiration)
- If email is not associated with the userId before cookie expires, the account becomes abandoned
- After skip, `user.id` is valid and normal socket APIs work correctly

### User Flow States

The late sign-up feature supports several user flow states, each tested by dedicated Storybook stories:

```
State 1: Unauthenticated User (Initial)
- No userId yet
- Answer step shows Terms & Privacy checkbox
- User must check Terms or login to proceed
- On Next button click (with Terms checked):
  - Call useAuth.methods.skip()
  - Page reloads with valid user.id
- All subsequent data stored in localStorage with key: `cp_${discussionId}_${userId}`
- Sign-up component NOT in step list

State 2a: Temporary User - Early Exit (Not Enough Participants)
- Has user.id but no user.email
- User completes Answer step
- Not enough participants to continue (< 2 * group_size)
- User goes directly to Intermission step
- User provides email, then batch-upsert only the Answer step data
- Only data for completed steps is sent (pointById, myWhyByCategoryByParentId)
- No groupIdsLists, idRanks, postRankByParentId, or whyRankByParentId
- Test: tournament-early-user.stories.js (NewUserNotEnoughParticipants)

State 2b: Temporary User - Full Flow (Enough Participants)
- Has user.id but no user.email
- User completes all 10 steps via UI interactions:
  Answer → Grouping → Rank → Why Most → Why Least →
  Compare Why Most → Compare Why Least → Review → Feedback → Intermission
- All data saved to localStorage throughout (not immediately to server)
- User provides email at Intermission, then batch-upsert all data
- Test: tournament-full-flow.stories.js (NewUserFullFlow)

State 3: Authenticated User - Returning to Complete Steps
- Has user.id AND user.email (authenticated)
- Previously completed Answer step (data in localStorage and also sent down by the server)
- Returns to complete remaining steps 2-10 via UI interactions
- Starts at Answer step with previous data, user clicks Next to get to Grouping step
- On reaching Intermission, batch-upsert all data
- Test: tournament-returning-user.stories.js (ReturningUserFlow)

State 4: Authenticated User (All Rounds)
- Has user.email associated with account
- Continues using localStorage throughout all rounds
- Data batch-upserted after each round completion
```

**Storybook Test Coverage:**

| Story File                             | Test Name                    | User State               | Steps Covered                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `tournament-early-user.stories.js`     | NewUserNotEnoughParticipants | Temp user, early exit    | Answer → Intermission           |
| `tournament-full-flow.stories.js`      | NewUserFullFlow              | Temp user, full flow     | All 10 steps with UI input      |
| `tournament-returning-user.stories.js` | ReturningUserFlow            | Authenticated, returning | Steps 2-10 with pre-loaded data |
| `tournament.stories.js`                | BatchUpsertInteractionTest   | Temp user, pre-populated | All steps (data in context)     |

**Key Implementation Notes:**

1. **Batch-upsert only includes completed step data** - If a user exits early (State 2a), only `pointById` and `myWhyByCategoryByParentId` are sent. Fields like `groupIdsLists`, `idRanks`, `postRankByParentId`, and `whyRankByParentId` are omitted since those steps weren't completed.

2. **UI-driven tests vs context-populated tests** - `tournament-full-flow.stories.js` and `tournament-returning-user.stories.js` use actual UI interactions (typing, clicking, drag-and-drop) to populate data. `tournament.stories.js` (BatchUpsertInteractionTest) pre-populates data via context for faster testing of the batch-upsert flow itself.

3. **Dynamic ID normalization in tests** - Stories that create new data via UI (answer points, why entries) generate random ObjectIds. Tests normalize these IDs before `toMatchObject` assertions to ensure deterministic verification.

### localStorage Data Structure

```javascript
// Key: `cp_${discussionId}_${userId}_${round}`
{
  discussionId: string,
  userId: string, // from user.id after skip
  round: number, // 0, 1, 2, etc.
  pointById: { [pointId]: Point },
  myWhyByCategoryByParentId: { most: {}, least: {} },
  postRankByParentId: { [parentId]: Rank },
  whyRankByParentId: { [parentId]: Rank },
  groupIdsLists: [[string]],
  jsformData: { [formName]: any },
  timestamp: number,
  roundComplete: boolean // Set to true when finish-round is called
}
```

## Detailed Changes

### Phase 1: Configuration & Step Order Changes

#### 1.1 Update iotas.json

**Files:** `iotas.json`

- **DO NOT modify existing iotas** - create one new iota with a new path and \_id for testing
- Remove `{ "webComponent": "SignUp", "startTab": "SignUp" }` from new iota's steps array
- Move Jsform "moreDetails" step from position 2 to after Tournament step, before Intermission
- Add `roundFilter: 0` to jsform step to only show in Round 1 (round 0 in code)

**Example structure for new iota:**

```json
{
  "_id": { "$oid": "NEW_ID_HERE" },
  "path": "/late-signup-test",
  "subject": "Test Late Sign-Up Flow",
  "steps": [
    // SignUp removed
    {
      "webComponent": "Tournament",
      "steps": [
        // Tournament internal steps
      ]
    },
    {
      "webComponent": "Jsform",
      "name": "moreDetails",
      "roundFilter": 0 // Only show in Round 1 (round 0 in code)
      // ... existing schema
    },
    {
      "webComponent": "Intermission"
    },
    {
      "webComponent": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: localStorage Integration

#### 2.1 Create localStorage Utility Module

**New File:** `app/lib/local-storage-manager.js`

**Functions:**

- `saveDeliberationData(discussionId, userId, round, data)` - Save data to localStorage
- `loadDeliberationData(discussionId, userId, round)` - Load data from localStorage
- `clearDeliberationData(discussionId, userId, round)` - Clear after successful upsert
- `isLocalStorageAvailable()` - Check if localStorage is available

**Implementation Notes:**

- Store with composite key: `cp_${discussionId}_${userId}_${round}`
- Include timestamp for data freshness validation
- Handle quota exceeded errors gracefully (log error, fall back to server-side only)
- Support data migration if schema version changes
- Return null/undefined gracefully if localStorage unavailable

#### 2.2 Update DeliberationContext

**File:** `app/components/deliberation-context.js`

**Changes:**

- Always use localStorage as primary data store (when available)
- Load localStorage data on mount for current round
- Override upsert function to:
  1. Update context state (existing behavior)
  2. Save to localStorage
  3. Do NOT immediately call socket APIs
- Add method to batch-upsert localStorage data at round completion
- Track current round in localStorage
- After round completion and successful batch-upsert, clear that round's localStorage

**New exports:**

- `useLocalStorageIfAvailable()` - Returns boolean indicating if localStorage is being used
- `flushRoundToServer(round, callback)` - Batch upsert method for a specific round

### Phase 3: Step Component Modifications

#### 3.1 Update Answer Step (Round 1 / round 0 only)

**File:** `app/components/steps/answer.js`

**Changes:**

- Add Terms & Privacy UI at bottom of step (only if `!user?.email`)
- Use `useAuth` hook from civil-client:
  - `methods.onChangeAgree` for checkbox state
  - `methods.skip()` to create temporary account on Next button click
  - Display `state.info`, `state.error`, `state.success` from useAuth
- Modify `handleOnDone`:
  - Always save to localStorage (when available)
  - Do NOT call socket emit
- Valid status depends on:
  - Answer and Why are valid AND
  - (User has user.id OR Terms checkbox is checked)
- On Next button click (via StepFooter):
  - If Terms checked and no user.id: call `methods.skip()` which triggers page reload
  - If user.id exists: proceed normally (StepSlider handles navigation)

**New Components:**

- `<TermsAgreement />` - Embedded at bottom of Answer step
  - Checkbox for Terms & Privacy agreement
  - Uses useAuth.methods.onChangeAgree
  - Shows useAuth state messages (info/error/success)
  - Note: Skip is called when user clicks Next button, not immediately on checkbox change

#### 3.2 Update Rerank Step

**File:** `app/components/steps/rerank.js`

**Changes:**

- Always save rank data to localStorage (when available)
- Store onNext data in context state (not as a function reference)
- When valid, prepare onNext callback but let StepSlider execute it normally
- The onNext callback should save final round state to context:
  - `shownStatementIds` with ranks
  - `groupings`
  - `finished: true`
- Do NOT call `window.socket.emit('finish-round', ...)` here
- The finish-round call will happen in intermission batch-upsert API

#### 3.3 Update Intermission Step

**File:** `app/components/intermission.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Check if user has `user.id` but no `user.email` and Round 1 (round 0 in code) just completed
- If temporary user at Round 1 completion:
  - Show email input form (already exists for unregistered users)
  - On email submission:
    1. Call new batch-upsert API with all localStorage data for the round
    2. API internally handles finish-round logic
    3. Server associates email with existing userId
    4. Clear localStorage for completed round after successful response
- Add loading state during batch upsert
- Handle errors gracefully (allow retry, show error message)

**New UI States:**

- "Please provide your email to continue" (existing)
- "Processing your responses..." (new, during batch upsert)
- "Error saving data, please try again" (new, error state)

#### 3.4 Update Other Steps with Socket Emits

**Files:**

- `app/components/steps/why.js`
- `app/components/steps/rank.js`
- `app/components/steps/compare-whys.js`
- `app/components/jsform.jsx`
- `app/components/steps/conclusion.js`

**Changes for each:**

- Import localStorage manager
- Always save to localStorage (when available)
- Do NOT immediately call socket emit APIs during round progression
- Use consistent data structure for localStorage
- Maintain existing behavior for reading data from server (get-points-of-ids, etc.)

### Phase 4: Server-Side Changes

#### 4.0 Refactor: Filter User's Own Points (myPointById)

**Problem:** Currently `pointById` in batch-upsert contains both the user's point AND points from other users that were fetched from the server. The API should only receive data generated by the user.

**Complications:**

- New users don't have a `userId` when they first reach the Answer Step
- Security policy: `userId` is filtered from points before they are sent to the browser
- Server cannot trust `userId` in the payload

**Solution Overview:**

1. **Client-side (answer.js):** When saving user's point, set `userId: user?.id || 'unknown'` if no userId yet
2. **Client-side (intermission):** When sending batch-upsert, create `myPointById` by filtering `pointById` for points matching `userId` or `'unknown'`. Upon successful upsert, update local points with the new `userId` (replacing `'unknown'` with actual userId)
3. **Server-side:** Accept points via `myPointById`, filter for `userId === synuser.id || userId === 'unknown'`, update `'unknown'` to actual userId

**Files to Change:**

**Implementation Details:**

**1. answer.js - Set userId to 'unknown' for New Users**

```javascript
// When user creates their answer point
const newPoint = {
  _id: new ObjectId().toString(),
  subject: answerSubject,
  description: answerDescription,
  parentId: discussionId,
  userId: user?.id || 'unknown', // Use 'unknown' if no userId yet
}
// Store in pointById as usual
upsert({ pointById: { [newPoint._id]: newPoint } })
```

**2. intermission.jsx - Filter to Create myPointById**

```javascript
// Filter pointById to only include user's own points
const myPointById = Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(data.pointById || {}).filter(([id, point]) => point.userId === userId || point.userId === 'unknown'))

const batchData = {
  discussionId,
  round,
  email: emailAddress,
  data: {
    myPointById, // Only user's points (filtered from pointById)
    // ... rest unchanged
  },
}
```

**3. batch-upsert-deliberation-data.js - Server-side Filtering**

```javascript
// Filter points to only allow user's own points
const validPoints = Object.values(data.myPointById || {}).filter(point => point.userId === userId || point.userId === 'unknown')

// Update 'unknown' userId to actual userId
for (const point of validPoints) {
  if (point.userId === 'unknown') {
    point.userId = userId
  }
}

// Validate only 1 point allowed
if (validPoints.length > 1) {
  return cbFailure('Only one statement allowed per user')
}
```

**4. Update Test Stories**

- Verify batchData assertions check for `myPointById` with filtered points only
- Add test case in `answer.stories.js` for new user scenario with `userId: 'unknown'`

#### 4.1 New Socket API: batch-upsert-deliberation-data

**New File:** `app/socket-apis/batch-upsert-deliberation-data.js`

**Purpose:** Accept accumulated localStorage data and process all upserts atomically, including finish-round logic

**Parameters:**

```javascript
{
  discussionId: string,
  round: number,
  email: string, // Optional, if provided associate with userId
  data: {
    pointById: {},
    myWhyByCategoryByParentId: {},
    postRankByParentId: {},
    whyRankByParentId: {},
    groupIdsLists: [],
    jsformData: {},
    uInfo: { // The round's uInfo with finished: true
      shownStatementIds: {},
      groupings: [],
      finished: true
    }
  }
}
```

**Process:**

1. Verify `this.synuser.id` is valid, fail if not authenticated
2. If email provided: associate email with `this.synuser.id`
3. Overwrite any existing data for this user/discussion/round (no duplicate detection needed)
4. Upsert all points using existing `insert-dturn-statement` logic
5. Upsert all whys using existing `upsert-why` logic
6. Upsert all ranks using existing `upsert-rank` logic
7. Upsert jsform data using existing `upsert-jsform` logic
8. Call `finish-round` logic internally with idRanks and groupings from data.uInfo
9. Return success (do not return userId, server already knows it)

**Error Handling:**

- Validation failures for any data
- Database errors
- Sequential operations with idempotency checks (transactions deferred to Phase 2)
- Return specific error messages for debugging

**Implementation Notes:**

- This consolidates multiple socket API calls into one atomic operation
- Reuses existing validation logic from individual upsert APIs
- The finish-round logic should be called last, after all data is successfully saved
- **Phase 1 (initial)**: Sequential operations with idempotency checks
- **Phase 2 (future)**: Add MongoDB transactions when replica set is available (requires M10+ Atlas tier or replica set in test environment)

#### 4.2 Existing Socket APIs - No Changes Needed

**Files:**

- `app/socket-apis/insert-dturn-statement.js`
- `app/socket-apis/upsert-why.js`
- `app/socket-apis/upsert-rank.js`
- `app/socket-apis/finish-round.js`

**No changes required.** These APIs will be called by the new batch-upsert API on the server side, or can continue to work for any flows that don't use localStorage.

#### 4.3 subscribe-deliberation - Likely No Changes Needed

**File:** `app/socket-apis/subscribe-deliberation.js`

**Analysis:** After `useAuth.skip()` is called and the page refreshes, `this.synuser.id` will be valid. The existing API should work without modification. If issues are discovered during implementation, document them here.

### Phase 5: Step-Footer Integration

#### 5.1 StepFooter - No Changes Needed

**File:** `app/components/step-footer.jsx`

**Analysis:** Answer step will control its own valid state by calling `onDone({ valid: false })` until Terms are checked or user has user.id. StepFooter already respects the `active` prop passed from step state. No changes needed.

**Note:** Any "why Next is disabled" messaging should be shown in the Answer step itself, not in StepFooter.

#### 5.2 StepSlider - No Changes Needed

**File:** `app/components/step-slider.jsx`

**Analysis:** With the always-use-localStorage approach, StepSlider can continue to execute onNext callbacks normally. The onNext callback from rerank will simply update context state (not call socket APIs). No queueing mechanism needed.

**Note:** If issues arise during implementation, document them here.

### Phase 6: Tournament Component Updates

#### 6.1 Filter Steps by Round

**File:** `app/components/tournament.js`

**Changes:**

- Add step filtering logic based on round
- Filter out jsform "moreDetails" after Round 1 (round 0 in code)
- Ensure step indices remain consistent across rounds

**New function:**

```javascript
function filterStepsByRound(steps, round) {
  return steps.filter(step => {
    if (step.roundFilter === undefined) return true // No filter, show in all rounds
    return step.roundFilter === round // Show only if round matches
  })
}
```

## Questions & Concerns

### Critical Questions

1. **Q:** How do we handle users who close the browser mid-Round 1 before providing email?
   **A:** localStorage persists data across browser sessions. On return, check for existing data and restore state. Implement 7-day TTL to clean up abandoned sessions.

2. **Q:** What happens if a user completes Round 1 on Device A, then tries to access on Device B?
   **A:** The userId from skip is device-specific (tied to session cookie). After email signup on Device A, data is server-side and associated with email. Device B would need to login with that email to access the same account. Without email association, Device B starts as a new temporary user.

3. **Q:** How do we prevent duplicate submissions or data corruption if batch-upsert fails mid-process?
   **A:** For initial implementation, use sequential operations without MongoDB transactions (transactions require replica sets which aren't available on free tier or standard test setup). Implement idempotency and error recovery:

   ```javascript
   // Phase 1: Without transactions (initial implementation)
   async function batchUpsert(data) {
     try {
       // Check if round already finished (idempotency)
       const existingUInfo = await Dturns.findOne({
         discussionId,
         userId,
         round,
       })
       if (existingUInfo?.finished) {
         return { success: true, message: 'Round already completed' }
       }

       // Validate all data using Joi schemas before upserting
       const pointSchema = Joi.object({
         _id: Joi.string().required(),
         subject: Joi.string().required(),
         description: Joi.string().required(),
         parentId: Joi.string().required(),
         userId: Joi.string().required(),
         // category is NOT required for points
       })

       const whySchema = Joi.object({
         _id: Joi.string().required(),
         subject: Joi.string().required(),
         description: Joi.string().required(),
         parentId: Joi.string().required(),
         userId: Joi.string().required(),
         category: Joi.string().required(), // category IS required for whys
       })

       // Use existing rankSchema from upsert-rank.js
       const rankSchema = Joi.object({
         _id: Joi.string(),
         parentId: Joi.string().required(),
         userId: Joi.string().required(),
         category: Joi.string().required(),
       })

       // Prepare arrays for bulk operations
       const points = Object.values(data.pointById)
       const whys = []
       for (const category in data.myWhyByCategoryByParentId) {
         for (const why of Object.values(data.myWhyByCategoryByParentId[category])) {
           whys.push({ ...why, category }) // Add category to why object
         }
       }
       const ranks = Object.values(data.postRankByParentId)

       // Validate all data
       for (const point of points) {
         const { error } = pointSchema.validate(point)
         if (error) {
           logger.error(`Point validation failed: ${error.message}`)
           return cb(undefined)
         }
       }

       for (const why of whys) {
         const { error } = whySchema.validate(why)
         if (error) {
           logger.error(`Why validation failed: ${error.message}`)
           return cb(undefined)
         }
       }

       for (const rank of ranks) {
         const { error } = rankSchema.validate(rank)
         if (error) {
           logger.error(`Rank validation failed: ${error.message}`)
           return cb(undefined)
         }
       }

       // Use MongoDB bulk operations for efficiency
       // Points collection
       if (points.length > 0) {
         const pointOps = points.map(point => ({
           updateOne: {
             filter: { _id: point._id },
             update: { $set: point },
             upsert: true,
           },
         }))
         await Point.bulkWrite(pointOps)
       }

       // Whys are also in Points collection (with category)
       if (whys.length > 0) {
         const whyOps = whys.map(why => ({
           updateOne: {
             filter: { _id: why._id },
             update: { $set: why },
             upsert: true,
           },
         }))
         await Point.bulkWrite(whyOps)
       }

       // Ranks collection
       if (ranks.length > 0) {
         const rankOps = ranks.map(rank => ({
           updateOne: {
             filter: { parentId: rank.parentId, userId: rank.userId },
             update: { $set: rank },
             upsert: true,
           },
         }))
         await Rank.bulkWrite(rankOps)
       }

       // Upsert jsform data if present
       if (data.jsformData && Object.keys(data.jsformData).length > 0) {
         for (const [name, formData] of Object.entries(data.jsformData)) {
           await upsertJsform(discussionId, name, formData)
         }
       }

       // Only mark as finished if all succeeded
       await finishRound(discussionId, round, data.uInfo.groupings)

       return cb({
         points: points.length,
         whys: whys.length,
         ranks: ranks.length,
       })
     } catch (error) {
       // Return undefined on error for client to handle
       logger.error('Batch upsert failed:', error)
       return cb(undefined)
     }
   }

   // Phase 2: With transactions (future enhancement, requires replica set)
   // TODO: Uncomment when MongoDB replica set is available
   // const session = await Mongo.client.startSession()
   // try {
   //   await session.withTransaction(async () => {
   //     await Point.bulkWrite(pointOps, { session })
   //     await Point.bulkWrite(whyOps, { session })
   //     await Rank.bulkWrite(rankOps, { session })
   //     await finishRound(discussionId, round, groupings, { session })
   //   })
   // } finally {
   //   await session.endSession()
   // }
   ```

   **Recovery strategy:** If batch-upsert fails, client should retry the entire operation. The idempotency check prevents duplicate round completion. Partial data will be overwritten on retry (per spec requirement #3).

4. **Q:** Should we allow users to continue past Round 1 without email?
   **A:** No. Email is required at intermission to continue to Round 2. This is the natural checkpoint.

5. **Q:** What if localStorage is disabled or quota exceeded?
   **A:** Detect localStorage availability on mount. If unavailable, log error message and fall back to requiring sign-up upfront or proceeding with server-only mode (revert to immediate socket APIs). For quota exceeded: log error via `logger.error`, notify user, and attempt to proceed with server-only mode.

6. **Q:** How do we handle the `finish-round` socket call?
   **A:** The finish-round functionality is incorporated into the batch-upsert API. Only one API call is made from intermission, which handles all data upserts and finish-round logic internally on the server.

7. **Q:** What about `initUitems` and `getStatementIds` for temporary users?
   **A:** After `useAuth.skip()` is called and page reloads, `this.synuser.id` is valid. These calls work normally with the temporary userId - they use in-memory dturn state and don't require email association.

### Technical Concerns

1. **localStorage size limits**: Typical limit is 5-10MB. Need to monitor data size, especially for discussions with many points.

2. **Race conditions**: Batch upsert during intermission could conflict with other socket operations. Need proper sequencing.

3. **Testing complexity**: Need to test both authenticated and temporary user flows, localStorage edge cases, and migration scenarios.

4. **Browser privacy modes**: Private/Incognito mode may block localStorage. Need graceful degradation.

5. **Data consistency**: Ensure localStorage and server data structures remain in sync. Version the localStorage schema.

6. **Security**: Handled by `useAuth.skip()` method - uses server-generated userId with session cookie.

7. **Existing users**: Users who already have email should not see the Terms prompt. Detect via `user.email` property.

8. **Mobile/responsive**: Ensure Terms checkbox works well on mobile screens.

9. **Accessibility**: Terms checkbox must be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly.

10. **Analytics**: Track temporary → authenticated conversion rate, drop-off points.

**Implementation Notes:**

- `TermsAgreement` component created with stateful wrapper for interactive Storybook testing
- Answer step now shows Terms when `!user` (simplified logic, no round dependency)
- Validation factored into `calculateOverallValid` helper that takes `validByType` and `agreeState`
- `TermsAgreement` calls `onDone({ agree, valid, value })` where value is 1 if checked, 0 if unchecked
- All Answer step stories updated with correct round prop type (number, not string)
- localStorage clearing moved to `DeliberationContextDecorator` for proper test isolation
- New test: `AnswerStepWithTermsAgreement` verifies Terms checkbox enables Next button

### Phase 4: Rerank & Intermission Updates

**Priority: High**

- [x] Update Rerank step to save data to context (not call socket APIs)
- [x] Update Intermission to detect temporary users at Round 1 (round 0) completion

- [x] Add loading and error states
- [x] Handle email association with userId

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ Updated Rerank and Intermission components
- ✅ Working end-to-end flow through Round 1 (client-side only, server API pending)
- ✅ Storybook tests: rerank-step (10 passing), intermission (14 passing including 4 new tests)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Rerank step now stores `roundCompleteData` in context instead of calling `finish-round` socket emit
- `onNext` callback in Rerank saves final round state (shownStatementIds, groupings, finished: true) to context
- Intermission detects temporary users: `user.id` exists but `!user.email` at Round 1 completion
- Batch-upsert flow uses context data (not localStorage directly) for flexibility in testing
- Added loading state with "Processing your responses..." message during batch upsert
- Error handling with retry capability if batch-upsert fails
- Success message shows with 2-second delay before page reload (to get updated user info)
- Page reload skipped when viewing in Storybook (checks for `'iframe.html?viewMode=story'` in URL)
- localStorage cleared for completed round after successful batch-upsert (when available)
- New Storybook tests: TemporaryUserRound1Complete, TemporaryUserBatchUpsertSuccess, TemporaryUserBatchUpsertFailure, TemporaryUserInvalidEmail

### Phase 5: Server-Side APIs

**Priority: High**

- [x] Create `batch-upsert-deliberation-data.js` socket API

- [x] Add TODO comments for future transaction implementation
- [x] Incorporate finish-round logic into batch-upsert API
- [x] Add server-side tests for new API

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ Working batch-upsert API with finish-round integration (211 lines)
- ✅ 17 comprehensive Jest tests (integration tests with dturn, edge cases, early user scenarios)
- ✅ Clear comments for future transaction enhancement when replica set is available

**Implementation Notes:**

- API validates all data using Joi schemas before any database operations
- Only allows 1 point per user in Round 0 (enforced at API level)
- Calls `insertStatementId` to register user's statement with dturn before database upserts
- Handles early user scenario: undefined idRanks/groupings means not shown yet, empty [] means incomplete
- finishRound only called when `idRanks.length > 0` (user has completed ranking)
- Idempotency check: if round already finished, returns success without re-processing
- Email association happens first before any data operations
- Bulk write operations for efficiency (updateOne with upsert for each collection)
- Integration tests use MongoMemoryServer and mock dturn module methods

### Phase 6: Additional Steps & Components

**Priority: Medium**

- [ ] Update Why step with localStorage support
- [ ] Update Rank step with localStorage support
- [ ] Update Compare Whys step with localStorage support
- [ ] Update Jsform with localStorage support

- [x] Create reusable auth flow mocking infrastructure

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ Comprehensive Storybook coverage within existing files
- ✅ Integration test suite (`BatchUpsertInteractionTest` simulates full flow)
- ✅ Backward compatibility verified for all components
- ✅ Reusable auth flow decorators in `stories/mocks/auth-flow.js`

**Implementation Notes:**

- localStorage clearing implemented in `DeliberationContextDecorator` using `useState` hook
- All tests use real browser localStorage (not mocked)
- `TermsAgreementWrapper` provides stateful mock for interactive Storybook testing
- New test stories: `AnswerStepWithTermsAgreement`, `AnswerStepWithAuthFlow`, `BatchUpsertInteractionTest`
- Auth flow decorators: `withAuthTestState`, `authFlowDecorator`, `authFlowDecorators`
- `withAuthTestState` HOC injects DeliberationContext.upsert into testState for context updates
- `authFlowDecorator` intercepts superagent.post('/tempid'), mocks socket reconnection, updates context with user.id
- `BatchUpsertInteractionTest` simulates complete flow: Terms checkbox → 10 tournament steps → email entry → batch-upsert
- Test uses data attributes (`data-transition-complete`, `data-height-stable`) to wait for animations
- All tests completing within default 15-second timeout (--testTimeout flag removed from package.json)
- a11y tests temporarily disabled in `.storybook/test-runner.ts` to prevent intermittent "Execution context destroyed" errors

- `app/socket-apis/finish-round.js` (called by batch API)
- `app/components/step-footer.jsx` (Answer controls valid state)
- `app/components/step-slider.jsx` (onNext executes normally)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- localStorage manager utility (save, load, clear, error handling)
- DeliberationContext localStorage integration
- TermsAgreement component (all states, useAuth integration)
- Each step component's localStorage integration
- batch-upsert-deliberation-data API with sequential operations and idempotency

### Integration Tests

- Full temporary user flow: Answer → Rerank → Intermission → Authenticated
- localStorage data persistence across page refreshes
- Batch upsert success and failure scenarios
- Round completion and localStorage clearing
- Step filtering by round
- Authenticated user flow (existing behavior should work)

### Storybook Stories

- Answer step with Terms agreement (checked/unchecked/has user.id/has user.email)
- Intermission with email prompt (temporary user at Round 1 completion)
- Tournament with late sign-up flow (add cases to existing file)
- Civil Pursuit with late sign-up flow (add cases to existing file)
- Error states (localStorage unavailable, batch upsert failure)

**Storybook Testing Limitations:**

Due to Storybook's architecture, certain authentication flows cannot be fully tested:

- `useAuth.methods.skip()` makes a real HTTP POST to `/tempid` (mocked in `.storybook/middleware.js`)
- After skip, `authenticateSocketIo()` disconnects and reconnects socket.io with auth cookie
- In a real browser, the page reloads with an authenticated session
- In Storybook, the socket reconnection and page reload don't happen

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Terms Checkbox Testing**: Use `user: undefined` to test Terms UI and validation. See `stories/answer-step.stories.jsx` `AnswerStepWithTermsAgreement` for example. Don't expect skip() to complete successfully.

2. **Post-Authentication Testing**: To test behavior after authentication, start stories with `user: { id: 'temp-id' }` to simulate the post-skip state. This skips the authentication step but tests all subsequent functionality.

3. **Full Integration Testing**: Use the `/tempid` mock in `.storybook/middleware.js` for components that call skip() (like SignUp), but understand the socket.io reconnection won't happen in Storybook.

**Documentation Locations:**

- `.storybook/middleware.js` - HTTP endpoint mocks with detailed comments
- `app/components/steps/answer.js` - Authentication flow documentation (lines 72-101)
- `stories/tournament.stories.js` - BatchUpsertInteractionTest comments explain testing approach

**TODO:** Investigate modern Storybook mocking solutions:

- msw-storybook-addon (Mock Service Worker)
- fetch-mock addon
  These might provide better ways to test authentication flows with socket.io reconnection.

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete temporary → authenticated user journey
- Browser refresh during Round 1
- Multiple tabs with same deliberation
- localStorage quota exceeded scenario
- Private/Incognito mode behavior

### Regression Tests

- Existing authenticated flow must work unchanged
- All existing tournament stories must pass
- All existing civil-pursuit stories must pass

## Success Metrics

1. **Conversion Rate**: % of temporary users who provide email at intermission
2. **Engagement**: % of users who complete Answer step (vs. bounce at old sign-up)
3. **Data Integrity**: 0 data loss during batch upsert operations
4. **Performance**: Batch upsert completes in <2 seconds for typical Round 1 data
5. **Error Rate**: <1% of users encounter localStorage or upsert errors
6. **Completion Rate**: % of users who complete Round 2 after late sign-up

## Rollback Plan

1. Use new test iota only - existing iotas remain unchanged for instant rollback
2. Feature can be disabled by reverting to SignUp-first step order in iota
3. Database operations are backward compatible (batch-upsert uses existing upsert logic)
4. localStorage data has expiration (doesn't accumulate indefinitely)
5. Monitor error rates and can revert iota configuration if issues arise

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-device Resume**: Allow users to enter email on Device A, receive link to resume on Device B with same userId
2. **Social Login**: Add Google/Facebook OAuth as alternative to email at intermission
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Only ask for email, add name/demographics later in the flow
4. **Email Pre-fill**: If user previously participated, recognize and pre-fill email at intermission
5. **Offline Support**: Use Service Workers to enable offline participation with sync on reconnect
6. **Data Export**: Allow users to download their localStorage data for transparency
7. **Extended Anonymous Participation**: For research scenarios where full anonymity is desired beyond Round 1

## Starting Point (Original Requirements)

Lets write a spec in this file for a new feature, "Late SignUp". It will require some refactoring.

Currently:
The user if first greeted with the app/components/sign-up page. However this is an obstacle to getting and idea for what this is all about, and building trust and interest in sighing up.
But technically, as the user goes through the steps of the deliberation, the data is upseted in to the database through socket api calls and it needs to be associated to a userId.
There is a Skip feature in the SignUp page that assigns a temporary userId for the user, but not many are doing that.

New Stuff:
The signon page is removed from the steps of civil pursuit, this is just a change to the iota in iotas.json for a deliberation.
The next step is jsform which asks some questions of the users. That will be moved to after the end of round 1 of the deliberation. (careful in code round starts a 0 but as presented to the user it starts at 1 which is how I will refer to it)
At the bottom of the Answer step, which is only show in round 1, if the user is not already logged in, we will show the checkmark for agreeing to the terms and privacy of the sign-up component or the user can login by entering email and password.
If the user checks agree, and then clicks the Next button of the step-footer.jsx of the step-slider, then a termId will be generated.
Next is not active until user check the box or logs in.
Now, all the steps that upsert data through api calls, should be modified to save the data into local storage. If the user leaves the page and comes back, this data should be retained. Us the discussionId and userId to make sure you are getting the right data.
The jsform step asking for moreDetails will be moved to the end of the steps of the tournament, just before the intermission step. And it will be filtered out from the steps after the first round.
After the user completes the review step (steps/rerank.js) it is setting up an onNext function to be called after the user hits the next button, this action needs to be delayed until the intermission step.
When the user gets to the intermission step for the first round, they will be asked to provide their email address.  
After the user provides their email address, then all the upsert data from the steps will be upserted, and the actions of onNext in rereank will be done.

Tests
We need to update the stories for all the steps involved, and create a new tournament story for this new situation, leaving the current story as is and making sure that story continues to work too.
The civil-pursuit story needs to be updated with a new story as well, and making sure the existing on continues to work.

Background of operation:
iotas.json is loaded into the Iotas collection on startup.
When the user access a path on the server, the path, including the leading /, is looked for in the Iotas collection.
Within the Iota, there is a webComponent property that has a webComponent property that is a string. That string is matched to the name of a component in app/web-components and that component is rendered with iota as one of it'ts props.
We are talking about the CivilPursuit component.
It renders a list of steps, which is a prop in iota, using step-slider.
One of the steps is the Tournament step.
That renders another series of steps, that are a prop in the above.
The user goes through the steps one by one.
We should look at "path": "/what-first-usa-1" as an example.
