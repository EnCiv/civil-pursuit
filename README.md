# Civil Pursuit Web Application

This is a tool to enable large scale deliberation online. It leads people through a discussion process, not chat, that engages them in finding what they agree on. The process stages are derived from in-person dialog and deliberation but here they can be automated and made to scale to support very large numbers of participants.

Before you begin, please review the [React Component guidelines and notes](https://github.com/EnCiv/.github/wiki/React-Coding-and-Style-Guidelines).

If you are not already, get on the [slack workspace](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee58BUiy12dtloG9pLITsELcNldIwXcEtCotV9r95BZJSIVA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee58BUiy12dtloG9pLITsELcNldIwXcEtCotV9r95BZJSIVA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and then getting the link it provides after submission to go to join slack.

To look for things to work on go to the ToDo column at the [Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/EnCiv/projects/1/views/1)
Look for issues that do not have anyone assigned. Also, issues toward the top may indicate that earlier issues are required first, so make sure those are closed, or look further down the list.

When you find one that you want to work on, assign it to yourself, or if you do not have permission yet, leave a comment saying you want to take this one.
You are also welcome to ask about issues on slack or the developers meeting. The dev meeting link and annoucments are posted in the #developers channel on slack.

Before you begin, please review the [React Component guidelines and notes]((https://github.com/EnCiv/.github/wiki/React-Coding-and-Style-Guidelines)) below.

Before you start coding, create a new branch for this issue:

```bash
git checkout -b short-issue-text#issue-number
```

For example `point-group#35`. The issue text should just be a word or two that make it distinct, and the the issue number.
Then when you are ready to create a PR for the issue, or if you just want to push the code so we can talk about it, do:

```
git push -u origin short-issue-text#issue-number
```

This will push the code to a new branch on github. (-u means upstream) After this first time, you only need to `git push` to push updates.
After your inital push, go to [github.com/EnCiv/civil-pursuit](https://github.com/EnCiv/civil-pursuit) and there will be a banner asking you if you want to creat a PR for this branch. Go ahead. Also, if you are only pushing this for review, there is a box you can check that says draft, or you can just day Draft in the comment title.
